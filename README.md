# Agentes Inteligentes
uMinho exercises for inteligent agents.

### 01 Message Sending

In this exercise we should have two agents, one who sends a message and other who receives it.

Key points here:

* You must follow the packages to start your agent classes, like MyAgents.Receiver(Just left everything as root(default) to avoid headaches)
* Java has weird things like nested classes. Behaviours usually are nested classes inside the agents.

### 02 Book borrowing

* TODO: review what exactly was asked about it!
